# HiFramework_unity

## 项目介绍
基于组件的项目管理框架,组件使用如下(更多文档查看[wiki](https://github.com/hiramtan/HiFramework_unity/wiki)):
```csharp
        var io = Center.Get<IOComponent>();
        var file = io.ReadFile("path");
```

## 使用方法

从此地址下载unitypackage:[![Github Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/atom/atom/total.svg)](https://github.com/hiramtan/HiFramework_unity/releases) 

ps.允许工程使用**unsafe**代码(项目中有对指针进行操作的逻辑).
